# Conway's Game of Life

A recode of Conway's Game of Life in openFrameworks as a programming project.

Clicking on a cell sets it to 'alive,' once you have clicked the desired cells (or used randomize), click play to watch them go!

Resizing the grid and randomizing the seed will reset the program to the beginning.

Use the sliders to change the colour of living cells, or the rate at which the grid updates.

When paused, you can use 'Next Frame' to step through one generation at a time.
